Freivald’s Algorithm
A,B,C are 3 Matrix
Generate an n × 1 random 0/1 vector r⃗.
Compute P⃗ = A × (Br)⃗ – Cr⃗.
Return true if P⃗ = ( 0, 0, …, 0 )T, return false otherwise.

Freivalds’ algorithm is a probabilistic randomized algorithm that works
in time O(n2) with high probability. In O(kn2) time the algorithm can
verify a matrix product with probability of failure less than 2-k.
Since the output is not always correct, it is a Monte Carlo randomized
algorithm.

Randomized Algorithms:
Randomized algorithms are classified in two categories.

Las Vegas: These algorithms always produce correct or optimum result
Monte Carlo: Produce correct or optimum result with some probability.
These algorithms have deterministic running time and it is generally
easier to find out worst case time complexity.
