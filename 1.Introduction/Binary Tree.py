# A binary tree is either empty or is made up of a node with two children or subtrees,
# left and right. The node at the top of the tree is the root, while the nodes with two
# empty children, at the bottom of the tree, are the leaves. A binary tree is perfect if all
# its leaves are at the same distance from the root. It is quasi-perfect if all its leaves are
# on, at most, two levels, the second level from the bottom is completely full and all
# the leaves on the bottom level are grouped to the left. Such a tree can conveniently be
# represented by an array, see Figure 1.3. The element at index 0 of this array is ignored.
# The root is found at index 1, and the two children of a node i are at 2i and 2i + 1.
# Simple index manipulations allow us to ascend or descend in the tree.
